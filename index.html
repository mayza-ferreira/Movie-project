              <strong><em>"Kiki's Delivery Service"</em></strong> is about a
              13-year-old witch who leaves home to begin her solo training in
              the trade of witchcraft, is an enchanting and inspiring tale that
              teaches the lesson that you can do anything if you believe in
              yourself. Young Kiki takes to the sky atop her broom and says
              goodbye to her friends and family as she must search for a new
              town where she can settle and learn how to be a witch on her own.
              A tradition amongst all witches that signifies their passage into
              adulthood. She lands in a bustling city with her best friend Jiji
              (her black cat, of course) and starts her new life, but is it as
              easy as she thinks it is?
